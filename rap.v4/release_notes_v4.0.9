elease Notes:  RAP v4.0.10

v4.0.10 - released September 23, 2019
* Fix to address RAP crashes that have occurred since the GFSv15 implementation, due to larger discrepancies between RAP and GFS solutions along the boundaries
   * Modified the updatebc code to smooth the differences between RAP and GFS, more robust than previous fix (v4.0.8)
   * New code runs successfully on cases where the operational RAP failed


* Repository Details
   * After cloning the rap.v4.0.10 branch of the EMC_rap git repository using the command below, retrieve the new code from the rap.v4 directory.
      * git clone -b rap.v4.0.10 https://${USER}@vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/code-review/a/EMC_rap
      * git clone -b rap.v4.0.10 ssh://${USER}@vlab.ncep.noaa.gov:29418/EMC_rap
   * The build script is located here: rap.v4/sorc/build_rap_all.sh
   * To build the code, run build_rap_all.sh and specify which codes you would like compiled within the script ("yes" or "no" switches).


* parm and sorc files changed
   * parm/rap_update_bc_parame.in
   * sorc/rap_update_bc.fd/da_update_bc.f90
   * sorc/rap_update_bc.fd/da_update_bc.F90


* revised executables
   * rap_update_bc


* resource changes
   * no additional resources are needed to run this version, and there is no effect on timing


* implementation instructions
   * Retrieve the new parm and sorc files
   * Recompile the update_bc code
   * A single test can be run to confirm the fix; EMC and GSD have done that for the 9/5 17Z crash.  No downstream systems needed to be tested, as the changes will be transparent to them.
