Release Notes:  RAP v4.0.14

v4.0.14 - released December 18, 2019
* Changes to RAP smartinit for RTMA/URMA version 2.8 upgrade
   * Consolidated the RAP codes for all grids into one source code
   * Added fields needed for use in the stability calculation for 10-m wind observations, for radiance data assimilation in RTMA and lapse-rate adjustment for 2-m temperature:
      * skin temperature, surface roughness, model surface pressure
      * pressure, temperature, mixing ratio, u, v, height at model level 1
      * pressure, temperature, and mixing ratio at model level 2
   * Added new temperature downscaling (that is used in the HRRR Smartinit) to the RAP Smartinit
   * Use land cover instead of vegetation type for coastal adjustment.  This only applies to CONUS, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, since Alaska is already using land cover for the coastal adjustment.
   * Puerto Rico grid was changed from 2.5 km to 1.25 km. 


* Repository Details
   * After cloning the rap.v4.0.14 tag of the EMC_rap git repository using the command below, retrieve the new code from the rap.v4 directory.
      * git clone -b rap.v4.0.14 https://${USER}@vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/code-review/a/EMC_rap
      * git clone -b rap.v4.0.14 ssh://${USER}@vlab.ncep.noaa.gov:29418/EMC_rap


* sorc/ush files changed
   * sorc/build_rap_all.sh
   * sorc/build_rap_smartinit.sh
   * sorc/rap_smartinit.fd
   * ush/rap_smartinit.sh

* fix files changed
   * fix/rap_smarttopopr.grib2
   * fix/rap_smartmaskpr.grib2

* sorc files deleted
   * build_rap_smartinit_ak.sh
   * build_rap_smartinit_conus.sh
   * build_rap_smartinit_hi.sh
   * build_rap_smartinit_pr.sh
   * rap_smartinit_ak.fd/
   * rap_smartinit_conus.fd/
   * rap_smartinit_hi.fd/
   * rap_smartinit_pr.fd/


* resource changes
   * Disk usage has increased by ~3 GB total/day.  RAP smartinit has increased from ~7 GB/day to ~10 GB/day.
   * There is no effect on timing


* implementation instructions
   * Retrieve the new fix files from the following location on Surge (not a best practice to store fix files in repo):
      * /gpfs/hps3/emc/meso/save/Benjamin.Blake/nwprod/rap.v4.0.14/fix
   * Retrieve the updated sorc directory, build scripts, and ush script, and re-build the smartinit code.  There will be one executable, rap_smartinit, instead of 4 executables, one for each domain.
