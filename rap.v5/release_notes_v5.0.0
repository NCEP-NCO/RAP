- pre-implementation testing requirements
   - need to test obsproc upgrade concurrently
   - need to run parallel HRRRs simultaneously, but the RAP parallel needs to be set up first
   - need to run HRRRDAS concurrently with HRRR CONUS, though HRRR CONUS can run without it
   - need to test verification code changes (those are the only downstream systems for which code changes are needed)
   - need to test smartinit update
   - please obtain initial guess files from the developers
   - please retrieve large fix files from the following directory on WCOSS: /gpfs/hps3/emc/meso/save/Benjamin.Blake/nwprod_final/rap.v5.0.0/fix

- Dissemination info
   - output should be placed into /gpfs/hps/nco/ops/com/rap/para
   - output should be placed on ftp server 
   - output should be placed on paranomads - a directory structure has been set up
   - request that all gempak output be transferred to DEVWCOSS as well as all awp130pgrb, awip32, and awp242 grib2 (awp242bgrb not needed)  files and prepbufr files
   - code is proprietary, and restricted data is used but is not disseminated

- Archive to HPSS
   - scripts may need to be modified to save extra forecast hours at 03/09/15/21z
   - Estimates for tarballs for runhistory
      - awip32: 11.2 GB/day to 12.1 GB/day
