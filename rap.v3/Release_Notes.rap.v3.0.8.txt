rap.v3.0.8 - released 1/18/2017
  Change method of adjusting land and water points
  from vegetation type to land/sea mask in the Alaska 
  smartinit to avoid temperature discontinuities. Also
  change specification of the vegetation type field 
  from VEG to VGTYP in the parm file that contains fields 
  requiring nearest neighbor interpolation.

sorc and parm files changed:
  /nwprod2/rap.v3.0.8/sorc/rap_smartinitak.fd/GETGRIB.f
  /nwprod2/rap.v3.0.8/sorc/rap_smartinitak.fd/NDFDgrid.f
  /nwprod2/rap.v3.0.8/parm/rap_neighbor_fields.txt

implementation instructions:
  Compile alaska smartinit as usual. Simply copy 
  rap_neighbor_fields.txt into the parm directory.
