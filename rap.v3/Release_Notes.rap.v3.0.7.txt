rap.v3.0.7 - released 11/2/2016
  Change terrain file to prevent crashes that occurred
  in 00z 27 and 28 October 2016 cycles. Also fix a typo
  in updatebc script for the partial cycle.

fix and scripts files changed:
  /nwprod2/rap.v3.0.7/fix/rap_geo_em.d01.nc
  /nwprod2/rap.v3.0.7/scripts/exrap_updatebc_pcyc.sh.ecf

implementation instructions:
  The rap_geo_em.d01.nc file has to be in place for the 
  12z makebc job. The 15z partial cycle begins by using
  a wrfinput file from the 12z makebc job. The terrain fix 
  is finally introduced into the full cycle at 21z when the
  first guess from the partial cycle is used in the 21z full
  cycle analysis.
