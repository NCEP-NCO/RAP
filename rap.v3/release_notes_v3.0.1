addition of new Hawaii-area grid (243)
large number of new parameters in all output files
Puerto Rico output now sent to AWIPS
elimination of 2-hr bucket accumulations of precipitation and snow, except in files sent to AWIPS
all output now available to f21
expanded CONUS smartinit grid and switch to consensus terrain and land mask files
new Hawaii smartinit output

      compute resource information
still runs every hour, but now to f21
forecast job changes from 18 nodes (16 tasks/node)  to 40 nodes (24 tasks/node)
analysis job changes from 8 nodes (8 tasks/node) to 10 nodes (8 tasks/node)
all post processor jobs change from 1 node (16 tasks/node) to 2 nodes (16 tasks/node)
history file format changed from binary to parallel netcdf
single cycle runtime changes from 32 to 42 minutes
runtime changes from 16 to 20 minutes for forecast job and from 5 to 9 minutes for analysis
disk space used per day changes from 1250G to 900G
       Data retention for files in /com and /nwges under prod/para/test environments
asking to maintain current retention of data in /com2 and /nwges in prod and recommend same retention for parallel.    asking to retain one extra day of /com2/nawips/prod/rap*

        new executables
                 o    rap_process_lightning
                 o    rap_process_enkf
                 o    rap_smartinit_hi
                 o    rap_subflds_g2
                 o    rap_update_fields
                 o    rap_ssrc
                 o    rap_wgrib2
		


        eliminated executables
                 o    rap_prdgen
                 o    rap_subflds_*
                 o    rap_update_height

        new jobs
                 o   JRAP_PROCESS_ENKF (run for 00,06,12,18 EnKF cycles);  run as a separate job (just like makebc);  the jobs should be run at +7:15 after the cycle time - i.e. the 12z EnKF processing  job should be run at 1915z
                 o   JRAP_FORECAST_RESTART (run as needed to revive a stalled forecast job)

        eliminated jobs
                 o   JRAP_PRDGEN
                 o   JRAP_PRDGENMGR
    
       pre-implementation testing requirements
need to test RTMA/URMA upgrade concurrently
need to test NARRE-TL upgrade concurrently
need to test obsproc upgrade concurrently
need to run parallel HRRR simultaneously
need to test verification updates (mainly for new forecast hours)
changes required for hysplt_rap2arl  which must be tested
small SREF changes needed to use grib2 RAP output
30-day evaluation will be required
suggested evaluators - AWC,SPC,WPC, all NWS Regions, FAA
please obtain initial guess files from the developers

       Dissemination info
output should be placed into /com2/rap/para, pcom2/para, and /com/nawips/para
output should be placed on ftp server
request that all gempak output be transferred to DEVWCOSS as well as all awp130pgrb, awip32, and awp242 grib2 files as well as prepbufr files
code is proprietary, and restricted data is used but is not disseminated

       Archive to HPSS
                 o     no changes recommended for RAP data on hpss      




V3.0.1 - Released February 17, 2016
Modified makefiles to use proper format for library paths
Changed analysis script to take advantage of the longer forecast length such that it can now go back further to look for first guess if needed
increased number of tasks in forecast jobs
